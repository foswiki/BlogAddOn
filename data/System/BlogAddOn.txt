   * Provides a handy interface with sorting and filtering options that can be INCLUDEd in any topic in the same Web
   * Optionally displays user pictures:
      * (In !WebPreferences or !%USERSWEB%.SitePreferences) point preference setting =BLOGPOSTADDON_AUTHOR_PICTURE_FIELD= to the field name of the user topic that contains the filename of the user picture. For example, for !PersonalInfoAddOn that field is named "Picture", so you would write: %BR%
